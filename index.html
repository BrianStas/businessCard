            <h2>Welcome  to my Portfolio!</h2>
            <p>My name is Brian Stasiukaitis, and I'm currently based out of Summerville, South Carolina.
                As a business-minded software developer and coder, I have a 
                few key goals for this site:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>demonstrate my coding ability through a portfolio</li>
                    <li>network with like-minded professionals to further develop my career</li>
                    <li>provide an easy route to contact me for business inquiries</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
       <p>Growing up most of my life in Charleston, South Carolina, I moved to Seoul, South Korea 
        once I graduated college. For 10 years, I studied Korean, taught children and generally had a good time.
         Now, back in the states, I'm working to develop my skills in coding and web development to solidify a 
         career path and improve my quality of life.</p>

       <p> Now a student at Thinkful, I'm looking to become the best I can at my new career 
        through education and experience. I'm always open to opportunities, and I'd love to work with you on unique projects!
       </p>
       <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy games both physical and digital, lifting heavy things, 
        and improving my cooking skills!</p>
